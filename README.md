# 🧬 scRNA-Seq Product Analyzer with A/B Testing

This project compares leading single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technologies such as 10x Genomics, Parse Bio, and others. It evaluates product specifications, scrapes public data, and simulates A/B tests to explore how variations in features (e.g., throughput, price, chemistry) affect adoption and satisfaction.
