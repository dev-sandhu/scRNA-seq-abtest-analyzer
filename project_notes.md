# Project Notes: scRNA-Seq Product Analyzer with A/B Testing

---

## Purpose

This project bridges biology and data science by simulating how a product manager might:
- Collect and compare data on scRNA-seq technologies
- Use A/B testing and sentiment analysis to make feature decisions
- Visualize results in a usable dashboard

It's ideal for someone with a background in **biological sciences + data science** transitioning into a product strategy or technical PM role in genomics or biotech.

---

## Real-World Use Case

At companies like **ScaleBio** or **10x Genomics**, product teams need to:
- Understand competitor strengths
- Validate ideas like reducing protocol time or cost
- Use feedback and data to make decisions

This tool models that workflow.

## Progress Summary

- Scraped specs from 10x Genomics
-  Next: Parse Bio & Mission Bio
-   NLP sentiment from forums
-    Simulated A/B testing (coming)

---

## Future Ideas

- Add user-upload support to compare their kits
- Add LLM module to generate strategy suggestions
- Predict market share impact with mock data
